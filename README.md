# 🔐 User Manager (Simulated) — Bash Script

This script simulates a basic user account management system for Linux/macOS environments.

##  Features
- Simulates creating, disabling, and deleting local users
- Logs every action to `user_actions.log`
- Menu-based terminal interface
- Bash-only, no external dependencies
- Great for practicing system user management automation

## 🛠️ DevOps Relevance
This script mirrors how DevOps teams manage users on remote servers:
- Similar to AWS IAM but for local machines
- Useful in provisioning, onboarding, and access control automation
- Can be scaled into Ansible or CI/CD flows

##  Usage

```bash
chmod +x user_manager.sh
./user_manager.sh
